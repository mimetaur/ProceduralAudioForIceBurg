### Core Sound

**ADDRESS**

`/iceburg/sensor`

`parameter #1: (INT): 0 - 5`: Sensor Number (0 through 5)

`parameter #2: (INT): 0 - 2`: Sensor Status (0 - off, 1, - on, 2 - correspondence)


**NOTES**

### Proximity Sound
**ADDRESS**

`/iceburg/proximity`

**PARAMETERS**

`parameter #1 (INT): 0 - 1`: Proximity (0 - off, 1 - On)

Proximity is triggered when a user gets close to the sculpture. It increases the intensity of the ambient sound.

### Overall Volume
**ADDRESS**

`parameter #1 (FLOAT): 0 - 1`: Volume Level

**NOTES**

This defaults to 1 (maximum) volume. This endpoint is exposed because access to sound hardware may be limited within the sculpture.
